## Lust

> **ALL features are 'critical'** &rarr; **overworking**, **reduced quality**

_How to avoid_:

- hierarchy of tasks even if all is important; force ranking
- release every 2-4 weeks

## Sloth

> **losing focus on doing high quality work** &rarr; **big delays**, **no schedule**, **lower quality**

_How to avoid_:

- testing, test-driven development
- pair programming
- simple design
- continuos integration
- refactoring

## Opaqueness

> **obscuring progress** &rarr; **not knowing true state of the project**

_How to avoid_:

- things are "done" or "not done" **no** "90%done"
- timeboxing
- make predictions

## Pride

> **I know everything to build the product** &rarr; **lack of stake holder & user involvement** &rarr;**lack of feedback**, **no learning**

_How to avoid_:

- make and refine user's stories

## Wastefulness

> **misuse of critical resourses** &rarr; **loss of creativity, motivation and time** &rarr; **delays**

_How to avoid_:

- timeboxing
- daily standups
- iteration retrospectives
- self-organizing team
- -spread intensity evenly

## Myopia

> **not seeing beyond your own work, the whole picture** &rarr; **delays**

_How to avoid_:

- make release plan
- make crossfunctional team
