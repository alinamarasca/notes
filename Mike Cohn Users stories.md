[Mike Cohn User's stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q5-cVeNjCE&t=1800s)

## What do user's stories address?

- define requirements
- communication between those who build and customer
- balance business/developers impact on project
- set priorities
- predict schedule

## What are user's stories?

**Ron Jeffries: 3 C's**

1. Card - physical card, reminder to do, to have &darr;
2. Conversation - take card, talk about it what, how, why
3. Confirmation - meet expectations

As a **user** i want to reserve hotel room.

As a **user** I want to cancel reservation.

As a **vacation traveler** I want to see photos of the hotels.

As a **frequent flyer** I want to rebook a past trip **so that I save time booking trips I take often**.


> ### As a user, I can cancel a reservation.

&rarr;

- Does the user get a full o partial refund?
  - Is refund a site credit or it goes back on user's credit card?
- How far ahead must the reservation be cancelled?
  - Is it the same time for all hotels?
  - Is it the same for all visitors?
- Is a confirmation provided to teh user?
  - How?

Create a test case. I cancel reservation, write **acceptance criteria**, what would satisfy users.

- verify that a premium member can cancel teh same day without fee
- verify non-premium member charged 10% for same day cancellation
- verify confirmation e-mail is sent
- verify that hotel is notified about cancellation

Or we can use smaller stories:

As a premium site member...

As a non-premium site member...

### Backlog

small things on the top - higher priority, big down - lower priority
New things will become visible when you solve it from the top. Break mid part into small tasks - **groom the backlog**.
**Theme** - group of related items. We write stories related to certain topic.
Some important big stories are called **epic**. Break them into smaller ones, and than again if needed.

## Writing user's stories.

**Logging in**
* As a **registered user** I am required to log in so that I can access the system.
* As a **forgetful user** I can request a password reminder so that I can log in if I forgot mine.
* As a **new user** I can create and account so that I can come back to saved materials.
* As a **user logging in for the 5th time** I can get a discount.
* As a **chief security officer** I want passwords be min 8 letters longs, using cases and special signs.

## How do you write user's stories?

- Brainstorm to generate stories
- No prioritization at first
- Write as many as possible
- **Think inside the box** - in you boundary.
- create hierarchy of user's story
- make presentation so things are not lost

## Why user's stories?

- shift focus from writing to talking, to discussion because words are imprecise.
- stories are understandable
- stories help to create ierarchy and switch between big and small things
- stories support participatory design (engage users - they write their own stories &rarr; better product)

Card(user's story) is a pointer to conversation. Conversation is more important than the card.
